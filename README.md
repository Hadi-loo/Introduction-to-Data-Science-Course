# Introduction to Data Science Course

## Introduction

This repository contains assignments and the final project for the Data Science course at the University of Tehran. Each assignment is a practical exercise in data science, covering key topics like data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Assignments utilize real-world datasets and tools in Python to develop hands-on skills. Additionally, the final project, which involves end-to-end work on a data science problem, challenges students to apply the full data science pipeline: from data collection to machine learning model development.

## Assignment 0: Web Scraping and Introductory Data Analysis

This assignment involved scraping transaction data from Etherscan using Pythonâ€™s requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, followed by basic analysis with pandas and matplotlib. We also examined various sampling methods and their effects on data analysis.

## Assignment 1: Statistical Analysis Tools

In this assignment, we used statistical analysis tools, including Monte Carlo simulation, to estimate values like pi and simulate a game outcome. We explored the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and performed hypothesis testing on datasets, including a study of GPA correlation with employment using a real-world dataset.

## Assignment 2: Open-Ended Question Analysis

Here, we worked on open-ended questions using datasets from the RMS Lusitania passenger information and salary statistics of scientists. Analysis was conducted to derive insights and answer broader research questions.

## Assignment 3: Spotify Dataset Insights

Using a Spotify dataset, this assignment involved gaining insights into song attributes. Data processing was done in pyspark, and visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Assignment 4: Loss Functions and Regression

We implemented basic loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to train a linear regression model on the Diabetes dataset. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) was compared to custom-trained models, with performance evaluated using R^2 and MSE scores.

## Assignment 5: Feature Engineering Techniques

This assignment covered feature engineering techniques for regression models on datasets related to sports outcomes and car attributes, using methods like multivariate regression and K-Fold validation.

## Assignment 6: Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

We implemented dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, to prepare datasets for clustering with K-Means and DBSCAN. The assignment focused on using these techniques to analyze diabetic data.

## Assignment 7: Semi-Supervised Learning and Large Language Models

This assignment included label propagation for semi-supervised learning on IMDB review data. We used the Phi-3 model as well as the SelfTraining method in sklearn for label prediction.
